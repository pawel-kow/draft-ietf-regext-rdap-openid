      <t>The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) provides "RESTful" web services to retrieve registration metadata from domain name and regional internet registries. RDAP allows a server to make access control decisions based on client identity, and as such it includes support for client identification features provided by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Identification methods that require clients to obtain and manage credentials from every RDAP server operator present management challenges for both clients and servers, whereas a federated authentication system would make it easier to operate and use RDAP without the need to maintain server-specific client credentials.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) provides "RESTful" web services to retrieve registration metadata from domain name and regional internet registries. RDAP allows a server to make access control decisions based on client identity, and as such it includes support for client identification features provided by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) <xref target="RFC7230"/>.</t>
      
      <t>RDAP is specified in multiple documents, including "HTTP Usage in the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)" <xref target="RFC7480"/>, "Security Services for the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)" <xref target="RFC7481"/>, "Registration Data Access Protocol Query Format" <xref target="RFC9082"/>, and "JSON Responses for the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)" <xref target="RFC9083"/>. RFC 7481 describes client identification and authentication services that can be used with RDAP, but it does not specify how any of these services can (or should) be used with RDAP.</t>
      
      <section anchor="problem" title="Problem Statement">
        <t>The traditional "user name and password" authentication method does not scale well in the RDAP ecosystem. Assuming that all domain name and address registries will eventually provide RDAP service, it is impractical and inefficient for users to secure login credentials from the hundreds of different server operators. Authentication methods based on user names and passwords do not provide information that describes the user in sufficient detail (while protecting the personal privacy of the user) for server operators to make fine-grained access control decisions based on the user's identity. The authentication system used for RDAP needs to address all of these needs.</t>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Proposal">
        <t>A basic level of RDAP service can be provided to users who possess an identifier issued by a recognized provider who is able to authenticate and validate the user. The identifiers issued by social media services, for example, can be used. Users who require higher levels of service (and who are willing to share more information about them self to gain access to that service) can secure identifiers from specialized providers who are or will be able to provide more detailed information about the user. Server operators can then make access control decisions based on the identification information provided by the user.</t>
            
        <t>A federated authentication system in which an RDAP server outsources identification and authentication services to a trusted OpenID Provider would make it easier to operate and use RDAP by re-using existing identifiers to provide a basic level of access. It can also provide the ability to collect additional user identification information, and that information can be shared with the consent of the user. This type of system allows an RDAP server to make access control decisions based on the nature of a query and the identity, authentication, and authorization information that is received from the OpenID Provider. This document describes a federated authentication system for RDAP based on OpenID Connect <xref target="OIDC"/> that meets all of these needs.</t>

      <t>The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="RDAP-FedAuth" title="Federated Authentication for RDAP">
      <t>RDAP itself does not include native security services. Instead, RDAP relies on features that are available in other protocol layers to provide needed security services including access control, authentication, authorization, availability, data confidentiality, data integrity, and identification. A description of each of these security services can be found in "Internet Security Glossary, Version 2" <xref target="RFC4949"/>. This document focuses on a federated authentication system for RDAP that provides services for authentication, authorization, and identification, allowing a server operator to make access control decisions. Section 3 of RFC 7481 <xref target="RFC7481"/> describes general considerations for RDAP access control, authentication, and authorization.</t>
        
      <t>The traditional client-server authentication model requires clients to maintain distinct credentials for every RDAP server. This situation can become unwieldy as the number of RDAP servers increases. Federated authentication mechanisms allow clients to use one credential to access multiple RDAP servers and reduce client credential management complexity.</t>

      <section anchor="RDAP-OIDC" title="RDAP and OpenID Connect">         
        <t>OpenID Connect 1.0 <xref target="OIDCC"/> is a decentralized, single sign-on (SSO) federated authentication system that allows users to access multiple web resources with one identifier instead of having to create multiple server-specific identifiers. Users acquire identifiers from OpenID Providers, or OPs. Relying Parties, or RPs, are applications (such as RDAP) that outsource their user authentication function to an OP. OpenID Connect is built on top of the authorization framework provided by the OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749"/> protocol.</t>
                
        <t>The OAuth authorization framework describes a method for users to access protected web resources without having to hand out their credentials. Instead, clients are issued Access Tokens by authorization servers with the permission of the resource owners. Using OpenID Connect and OAuth, multiple RDAP servers can form a federation and clients can access any server in the federation by providing one credential registered with any OP in that federation. The OAuth authorization framework is designed for use with HTTP and thus can be used with RDAP.</t>
      
        <section anchor="terms" title="Terminology">
          <t>This document uses the terms "client" and "server" defined by RDAP <xref target="RFC7480"/>. An RDAP client performs the role of an OpenID Connect Core <xref target="OIDCC"/> Entity or End-User. An RDAP server performs the role of an OpenID Connect Core Relying Party (RP). Additional terms from Section 1.2 of the OpenID Connect Core specification are incorporated by reference.</t>
        </section>
      
        <section anchor="overview" title="Overview">
          <t>At a high level, RDAP authentication of a browser-like client using OpenID Connect requires completion of the following steps:</t>
          
          <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>An RDAP client sends an RDAP "help" query to an RDAP server to determine the type of OpenID Authorization Server that's used by the RDAP server and its capabilities. This information is returned in the rdapConformance section of the response. A value of "rdap_openidc_local_level_0" indicates that the server uses a local Authorization Server. A value of "rdap_openidc_remote_level_0" indicates that the server uses a remote Authorization Server. In case of remote Authorization Server is supported the RDAP client SHOULD evaluate an additional information provided in <xref target="openidcRemoteConfiguration" /> in order to discover the capabilties of the RDAP server and optionally obtain a list of supported OPs.</t>
            <t>An RDAP client (acting as an OpenID End-User) sends an RDAP "login" request to an RDAP server as described in <xref target="client-login"/>.</t>
            <t>The RDAP server (acting as an OpenID Relying Party (RP)) prepares an Authentication Request containing the desired request parameters.</t>
            <t>The RDAP server sends the RDAP client and Authentication Request to an Authorization Server operated by an OpenID Provider (OP) using an HTTP redirect.</t>
            <t>The Authorization Server authenticates the End-User.</t>
            <t>The Authorization Server obtains End-User consent/authorization.</t>
            <t>The Authorization Server sends the RDAP Client back to the RDAP server with an Authorization Code using an HTTP redirect.</t>
            <t>The RDAP server requests a response using the Authorization Code at the Token Endpoint.</t>
            <t>The RDAP server receives a response that contains an ID Token and Access Token in the response body.</t>
            <t>The RDAP server validates the ID Token and retrieves the claims associated with the End-User's identity.</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          
          <t>The RDAP server can then make identification, authorization, and access control decisions based on End-User identity information and local policies. Note that OpenID Connect describes different process flows for other types of clients, such as script-based or command line clients.</t>
        </section>
        
        <section anchor="process" title="RDAP Authentication and Authorization Steps">
          <t>End-Users MUST possess an identifier (an OpenID) issued by an OP to use OpenID Connect with RDAP. An OP SHOULD include support for the claims described in <xref target="rdap-claims"/> to provide additional information needed for RDAP End-User authorization. OpenID Connect requires RPs to register with OPs to use OpenID Connect services for an End-User. The registration process is often completed using out-of-band methods, but it is also possible to use the automated method described by the "OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration" protocol <xref target="OIDCR"/>. The parties involved can use any method that is mutually acceptable.</t>
      
          <section anchor="discovery" title="Provider Discovery">
            <t>An RDAP server/RP needs to be able to map an End-User's identifier to an OP. This can be accomplished using the OPTIONAL "OpenID Connect Discovery" protocol <xref target="OIDCD"/>, but that protocol is not widely implemented. Out-of-band methods are also possible and can be more dependable. For example, an RP can support a limited number of OPs and maintain internal associations of those identifiers with the OPs that issued them.</t>
            <t>Alternatively, if mapping of End-User's identifier is not possible, or not supported by the RDAP server, the RDAP server SHOULD support an explicit specification of a remote OP by the RDAP client. An RDAP server SHOULD provide information about its capabilities and the supported OPs in the /help response in the <xref target="openidcRemoteConfiguration"/> data structure.</t>
            <t>An RP can also ask an End-User to identify the OP that issued their identifier as part of an RDAP query workflow. In this case, the RP will need to maintain state for the association between the user's identifier and the OP in order to process later queries that rely on passing the access token and user identifier as authorization parameters. An RP MAY use any provider discovery approach that is suitable for its operating environment.</t>
            <t>An RDAP server MUST support at least one of the methods of OP discovery.</t>
          </section>
      
          <section anchor="auth-request" title="Authentication Request">
            <t>Once the OP is known, an RP MUST form an Authentication Request and send it to the OP as described in Section 3 of the OpenID Connect Core protocol <xref target="OIDCC"/>. The authentication path followed (authorization, implicit, or hybrid) will depend on the Authentication Request response_type set by the RP. The remainder of the processing steps described here assume that the Authorization Code Flow is being used by setting "response_type=code" in the Authentication Request.</t>
            
            <t>The benefits of using the Authorization Code Flow for authenticating a human user are described in Section 3.1 of the OpenID Connect Core protocol. The Implicit Flow is more commonly used by clients implemented in a web browser using a scripting language; it is described in Section 3.2 of the OpenID Connect Core protocol. The Hybrid Flow (described in Section 3.3 of the OpenID Connect Core protocol) combines elements of the Authorization and Implicit Flows by returning some tokens from the Authorization Endpoint and others from the Token Endpoint.</t>
            
            <t>An Authentication Request can contain several parameters. REQUIRED parameters are specified in Section 3.1.2.1 of the OpenID Connect Core protocol <xref target="OIDCC"/>. Apart from these parameters, it is RECOMMENDED that the RP include the optional "login_hint" parameter in the request, with the value being that of the "id" query parameter of the End-User's RDAP "login" request, if provided. Passing the "login_hint" parameter allows a client to pre-fill login form information, so logging in can be more convenient for users. Other parameters MAY be included.</t>
            
            <t>The OP receives the Authentication Request and attempts to validate it as described in Section 3.1.2.2 of the OpenID Connect Core protocol <xref target="OIDCC"/>. If the request is valid, the OP attempts to authenticate the End-User as described in Section 3.1.2.3 of the OpenID Connect Core protocol <xref target="OIDCC"/>. The OP returns an error response if the request is not valid or if any error is encountered.</t>
          </section>
      
          <section anchor="End-User-auth" title="End-User Authorization">
            <t>After the End-User is authenticated, the OP MUST obtain authorization information from the End-User before releasing information to the RDAP Server/RP. This process is described in Section 3.1.2.4 of the OpenID Connect Core protocol <xref target="OIDCC"/>.</t>
          </section>
      
          <section anchor="auth-valid" title="Authorization Response and Validation">
            <t>After the End-User is authenticated, the OP will send a response to the RP that describes the result of the authorization process in the form of an Authorization Grant. The RP MUST validate the response. This process is described in Sections 3.1.2.5 - 3.1.2.7 of the OpenID Connect Core protocol <xref target="OIDCC"/>.</t>
          </section>
      
          <section anchor="tokens" title="Token Processing">
            <t>The RP sends a Token Request using the Authorization Grant to a Token Endpoint to obtain a Token Response containing an Access Token, ID Token, and an OPTIONAL Refresh Token. The RP MUST validate the Token Response. This process is described in Section 3.1.3 of the OpenID Connect Core protocol <xref target="OIDCC"/>.</t>
          </section>
      
          <section anchor="user-info" title="Delivery of User Information">
            <t>The set of claims can be retrieved by sending a request to a UserInfo Endpoint using the Access Token. The claims MAY be returned in the ID Token. The process of retrieving claims from a UserInfo Endpoint is described in Section 5.3 of the OpenID Connect Core protocol <xref target="OIDCC"/>.</t>
            
            <t>OpenID Connect specifies a set of standard claims in Section 5.1. Additional claims for RDAP are described in <xref target="rdap-claims"/>.</t>
          </section>
        </section>
      
        <section anchor="rdap-claims" title="Specialized Claims for RDAP">
          <t>OpenID Connect claims are pieces of information used to make assertions about an entity. Section 5 of the OpenID Connect Core protocol <xref target="OIDCC"/> describes a set of standard claims that can be used to identify a person. Section 5.1.2 notes that additional claims MAY be used, and it describes a method to create them. The set of claims that are specific to RDAP are associated with an OAuth scope request parameter value (see Section 3.3 of RFC 6749 (<xref target="RFC6749"/>)) of "rdap".</t>
            
          <section anchor="stated-purpose" title="Stated Purpose">
            <t>There are communities of RDAP users and operators who wish to make and validate claims about a user's "need to know" when it comes to requesting access to a resource. For example, a law enforcement agent or a trademark attorney may wish to be able to assert that they have a legal right to access a protected resource, and a server operator will need to be able to receive and validate that claim. These needs can be met by defining and using an additional "purpose" claim.</t>
            
            <t>The "purpose" claim identifies the purpose for which access to a protected resource is being requested. Use of the "purpose" claim is OPTIONAL; processing of this claim is subject to server acceptance of the purpose and successful authentication of the End-User. Unrecognized purpose values MUST be ignored and the associated query MUST be processed as if the unrecognized purpose value was not present at all.</t>
              
            <t>The "purpose" value is a case-sensitive string containing a StringOrURI value as specified in Section 2 of the JSON Web Token (JWT) specification (<xref target="RFC7519"/>). An example:</t>
              
            <t>{"purpose" : "domainNameControl"}</t>
             
            <t>Purpose values are themselves registered with IANA. Each entry in the registry contains the following fields:</t>
               
            <t>Value: the purpose string value being registered. Value strings can contain upper case characters from "A" to "Z", lower case ASCII characters from "a" to "z", and the underscore ("_") character. Value strings contain at least one character and no more than 64 characters.</t>
              
            <t>Description: a one- or two-sentence description of the meaning of the purpose value, how it might be used, and/or how it should be interpreted by clients and servers.</t>
              
            <t>This registry is operated under the "Specification Required" policy defined in RFC 5226 (<xref target="RFC5226"/>). The set of initial values used to populate the registry as described in <xref target="purpose-registry"/> are taken from the <eref target="https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/final-report-06jun14-en.pdf">final report</eref> produced by the Expert Working Group on gTLD Directory Services chartered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).</t>
          </section>
            
          <section anchor="dnt" title="Do Not Track">
            <t>There are also communities of RDAP users and operators who wish to make and validate claims about a user's wish to not have their queries logged, tracked, or recorded. For example, a law enforcement agent may wish to be able to assert that their queries are part of a criminal investigation and should not be tracked due to a risk of query exposure compromising the investigation, and a server operator will need to be able to receive and validate that claim. These needs can be met by defining and using an additional "do not track" claim.</t>
            
            <t>The "do not track" ("dnt") claim can be used to identify an End-User that is authorized to perform queries without the End-User's association with those queries being logged, tracked, or recorded by the server. Client use of the "dnt" claim is OPTIONAL. Server operators MUST NOT log, track, or record any association of the query and the End-User's identity if the End-User is successfully identified and authorized, the "dnt" claim is present, the value of the claim is "true", and accepting the claim complies with local regulations regarding logging and tracking.</t>
              
            <t>The "dnt" value is represented as a JSON boolean literal. An example:</t>
              
            <t>{"dnt" : true}</t>
            
            <t>No special query tracking processing is required if this claim is not present or if the value of the claim is "false". Use of this claim MUST be limited to End-Users who are granted "do not track" privileges in accordance with service policies and regulations. Specification of these policies and regulations is beyond the scope of this document.</t>

Specific processing requirements are beyond the scope of this document. A client can end a session explicitly by sending a "session/logout" request to the RDAP server. A session can also be ended implicitly by the server after a server-defined period of time. The status of a session can be determined at any time by sending a "session/status" query to the RDAP server.</t>

      <t>An RDAP server MUST maintain session state information for the duration of an active session. This is commonly done using HTTP cookies as described in RFC 6265 <xref target="RFC6265"/>. Doing so allows End-User to submit queries without having to explicitly identify and authenticate themselves for each and every query.</t>

      <t>NOTE: Please remove this section and the reference to RFC 7942 prior to publication as an RFC.</t>
      
      <t>This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 7942 <xref target="RFC7942"/>. The description of implementations in this section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs. Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF. Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors. This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their features. Readers are advised to note that other implementations may exist.</t>
      
      <t>According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature. It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as they see fit".</t>

      <t>Version -09 of this specification introduced changes that are incompatible with earlier implementations. Implementations that are consistent with this specification will be added as they are identified.</t>

        <t><ul empty="true" spacing="compact">
	    <li>Location: https://procuratus.net/rdap/</li>
	    <li>Description: This implementation is a functionally-limited RDAP server that supports only the path segments described in this specification. It uses the "jumbojett/OpenID-Connect-PHP" library found on GitHub, which appears to no longer be under active development. The library was modified to add support for the device authorization grant. Session variable management is still a little buggy. Supported OPs include Google (Gmail) and Yahoo.</li>

	    <li>Description: This implementation includes support for domain registry RDAP queries using live data from the .cc and .tv country code top-level domains and the .career generic top-level domain. Three access levels are provided based on the authenticated identity of the client:

	      <li>Unauthenticated: Limited information is returned in response to queries from unauthenticated clients.</li>
	      <li>Basic: Clients who authenticate using a publicly available identity provider like Google Gmail or Microsoft Hotmail will receive all of the information available to an unauthenticated client plus additional registration metadata, but no personally identifiable information associated with entities.</li>
	      <li>Advanced: Clients who authenticate using a more restrictive identity provider will receive all of the information available to a Basic client plus whatever information the server operator deems appropriate for a fully authorized client. Currently supported identity providers include those developed by Verisign Labs (https://testprovider.rdap.verisignlabs.com/) and CZ.NIC (https://www.mojeid.cz/).</li>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Security considerations for RDAP can be found in RFC 7481 <xref target="RFC7481"/>. Security considerations for OpenID Connect Core <xref target="OIDCC"/> and OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749"/> can be found in their reference specifications. OpenID Connect defines optional mechanisms for robust signing and encryption that can be used to provide data integrity and data confidentiality services as needed.</t>

      <section anchor="access" title="Authentication and Access Control">
        <t>Having completed the client identification, authorization, and validation process, an RDAP server can make access control decisions based on a comparison of client-provided information and local policy. For example, a client who provides an email address (and nothing more) might be entitled to receive a subset of the information that would be available to a client who provides an email address, a full name, and a stated purpose. Development of these access control policies is beyond the scope of this document.</t>
